Next steps:
Create your .env file:

Click Add file → Create new file

Name it .env (no extension)

Copy the contents from .env.example I gave you, then replace the placeholders with your actual Alpaca API keys.

Commit it with a message like: Add .env with API keys




Train your model:

Now you’ll need to train the ML model before running the bot.

You can do this locally if you have Python installed, or on a server later.





Run training locally (optional but recommended):

If you want, I can guide you through installing Python and running the training script on your computer. Just tell me your OS (Windows/Mac/Linux).





Run the bot:

After training, the bot file (crypto_trading_bot.py) will use the trained model (model.pkl) to trade.

I’ll help you set up everything to run it either locally or on AWS.




1. Training the Model Locally
Step A: Install Python & Tools
Windows: Download and install from python.org/downloads (make sure to check “Add Python to PATH” during install)

Mac: Python 3 comes pre-installed; you can install via Homebrew (brew install python) if needed

Linux: Use your package manager, e.g., sudo apt install python3 python3-pip

Step B: Setup your project folder locally
Clone your GitHub repo to your local machine (or create a folder and copy files there)

Open terminal/command prompt, navigate to the folder

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/crypto-trading-bot.git
cd crypto-trading-bot
Step C: Create & activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
bash
Copy
python -m venv venv
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# Mac/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
Step D: Install dependencies
bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Step E: Prepare your .env file locally
Create .env in the project root

Add your API keys (copy from .env.example and fill)

Step F: Train the model
bash
Copy
python train_model.py
This will create model.pkl in your folder.

2. Running the Bot Locally
Make sure:

Your .env file has the correct keys

model.pkl exists after training

Run:

bash
Copy
python crypto_trading_bot.py
The bot will start and run continuously (it checks data every minute). You can stop it anytime with Ctrl + C.

3. Deploying on AWS EC2 (Summary)
Step A: Create AWS account
Sign up at aws.amazon.com if you don’t have an account

Step B: Launch an EC2 instance
Go to EC2 Dashboard

Click Launch Instance

Choose Amazon Linux 2 AMI (Free tier eligible)

Choose t2.micro instance type (free tier)

Configure details, storage (default is fine)

Configure security group: allow SSH (port 22) and optionally port 8888 if using Jupyter or custom ports

Review and launch (you’ll create/download a key pair for SSH access)

Step C: SSH into your instance
bash
Copy
ssh -i /path/to/your-key.pem ec2-user@your-ec2-public-ip
Step D: Install Docker
bash
Copy
sudo yum update -y
sudo amazon-linux-extras install docker
sudo service docker start
sudo usermod -a -G docker ec2-user
Log out and back in or run newgrp docker for group changes to take effect

Step E: Clone your GitHub repo on EC2
bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/crypto-trading-bot.git
cd crypto-trading-bot
Step F: Add .env file on EC2
Use nano .env and paste your API keys

Step G: Build and run Docker container
bash
Copy
docker build -t crypto-bot .
docker run -d --env-file .env crypto-bot
Step H: Monitor logs
bash
Copy
docker logs -f container_id
Notes:
Replace your-username and your-ec2-public-ip with your actual GitHub username and EC2 IP

Keep your .pem key safe

You can stop/start your instance via AWS console
